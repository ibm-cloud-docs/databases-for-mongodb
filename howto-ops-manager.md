# MongoDB OpsManager
{: #ops-manager}
The MongodDB OpsManager is only available with an {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb_full}} Enterprise Edition deployment.

## Before you begin with the MongodDB OpsManager

- You need to have an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration){:new_window}.
- And a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition deployment. You can provision one from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/databases-for-mongodb). Give your deployment a memorable name that appears in your account's Resource List.
- [Set the Admin Password](/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-admin-password) for your deployment.
- [Create an Ops Manager username and password](/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-user-management.md) for your deployment by using the [Cloud Databases API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api). Note: the OpsManager user has limited permissions.


## Initial login
{: #initial-login}

The {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition service is provisioned with access to the MongodDB Ops Manager user interface.

After you create an OpsManager username and password by using the [Cloud Databases API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api), you must follow these instructions to get access to the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition instance within the OpsManager UI:

1. Log in with the OpsManager username and password you created for your deployment:
   
    ![The MongoDB Enterprise Edition OpsManager login pane](images/opsman-login.png)

2. In the resulting view, select the 'Invitations' tab:
  
    ![The Ops Manager invitations pane](images/opsman-invitations.png)

3. Click 'Accept' for the invitation as role 'Project Data Access Admin'. This step adds your Ops Manager user ID to the Organization and project shown:
  
    ![The Ops Manager accepted invitations success pane](images/opsman-invite-success.png)

4. Lastly, to navigate to the instance view: 
   - Click the 'OpsManager' logo in the menu bar, 
   - Or select the 'All Clusters' link:
    
    ![The MongoDB Enterprise Edition Ops Manager instance view pane](images/opsman-instance-view.png)

On subsequent logins you arrive at the last view, so the prior procedure is only necessary on the first login.
{: .tip}

If a user is removed from the Ops Manager, there is no method to manually resend an invitation. To add a user back to the Ops Manager interface, you need to delete the user with command `opsmanager_delete_user` first then create the same user again. The invitation is again available in the `Invitations` pane as noted in the prior `Initial login` steps. 

## Connecting through private endpoints
{: #private-endpoints}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition offers an HTTPS accessible endpoint for the Ops Manager user interface. 

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition also offers both private and public cloud service endpoints. If you want to access the Management UI from a browser that is not on the private network, you must take these additional steps as listed in the [Connecting Through Private Endpoints](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints##private-endpoint-connections) documentation for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Databases.

After you have configured your environment for private endpoint access, you can navigate to the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise management endpoint URL from your browser. For example, `https://bfdb-4263-8ad2-c9a4beaf4591.8f7bfc8f3faa4218afd56e0.databases.appdomain.cloud:323232`


## Ops Manager API key creation and usage

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} Enterprise Edition provides access to the Ops Manager API through generation of API keys. To do this: 
* Navigate to your `Account` page 
* From the `Public API Access` tab, you are able to generate up to ten API keys by using the `Generate` button. 

![API Keys pane](images/api-keys.png)
These are the 'deprecated' personal API-keys.
{: .note}

Using the Ops Manager connection string (found in the [Getting connection strings](/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-getting-connection-strings.md) pane of your deployment), you can use the credentials that you created for Ops Manager user access to API commands. 

### Example connection details: 
 
You can use the example credentials as follow to query the Ops Manager 'user' API:
* Example username that you created via the API: 
  * `opsmanager-123`
* Example API key that is generated by using the prior steps: 
  * `d043b2ae-bbf2-4f55-8b09-e1ce0906126f` 
* Example connection string obtained from the deployment dashboard Connections pane: 
  * `https://opsmanager-d66861a0-9ec2-4d14-9f66-15d4ad4547ac.9b48689db8eb415ca00444450bd4e589.databases.appdomain.cloud:30649`  

Combine to form the following example command: 
```
curl -k --digest --user 'opsmanager-123:d043b2ae-bbf2-4f55-8b09-e1ce0906126f'  'https://opsmanager-d66861a0-9ec2-4d14-9f66-15d4ad4547ac.9b48689db8eb415ca00444450bd4e589.databases.appdomain.cloud:30649/api/public/v1.0/users/byName/opsmanager-123'
```
{: .pre}

## Updating the OpsManager user record by using the OpsManager API

When you create an OpsManager user prior to the initial login steps previously noted, you defined the username and password as arguments. This username can't be changed via the OpsManager API or UI, and the password can only be changed via the UI. However, you can update these values by using the OpsManager 'user' API.

The OpsManager 'user' API requires several other values to be set when creating a user. These fields are set to 'opsmanager' by default:
* firstName
* lastName
* emailAddress

With your own username and API key that is generated in the prior steps, you can follow this example command to update these fields:
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -XPATCH -k --digest --user 'opsmanager-123:d043b2ae-bbf2-4f55-8b09-e1ce0906126f'  'https://opsmanager-d66861a0-9ec2-4d14-9f66-15d4ad4547ac.9b48689db8eb415ca00444450bd4e589.databases.appdomain.cloud:30649/api/public/v1.0/users/5f07020545a4e8013688627a' -d '{"firstName": "your first name", "lastName": "your last name, "emailAddress": "your e-mail"}'
```
{: .pre}

## After a restore

You will see the source formation replica set in the OpsManager interface after a restore completes. Note that the menu as seen in the following screen capture does not contain the 'remove' item since the OpsManager user created during the initial login steps doesn't have the corresponding permissions.
