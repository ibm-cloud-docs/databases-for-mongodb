## Choosing a plan
{: #mongodb-plans-choosing}

- Choose the **Standard plan** for general-purpose workloads that need managed MongoDB with automated backups and a flexible hosting model.  
- Choose the **Enterprise plan** for workloads that require Ops Manager, Point-in-Time Recovery, advanced monitoring, or detailed auditing to meet compliance and regulatory needs.
