# Connecting an external application
{: #external-app}

Your applications and drivers use connection strings to make a connection to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb_full}}. Each deployment has connection strings specifically for drivers and applications. 

## Getting Connection Strings

The easiest way to get connection strings for an application is to create a set of _Service Credentials_ specifically for your application to connect with. Doing so also returns all the connection information a JSON object in a click-to-copy field.

Alternatively, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI [cloud databases plug-in](/docs/services/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-connection-strings) supports generating users and connection strings, as does the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#creates-a-database-level-user).

Full documentation on generating and retrieving connection strings is on the [Getting Connection Strings](/docs/services/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-connection-strings) page.

## Using Connection Information

All the information a driver needs to make a connection to your deployment is in the "MongoDB" section of your connection strings. The table contains a breakdown for reference.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Type`||Type of connection - for MongoDB, it is "URI"
`Scheme`||Scheme for a URI - for MongoDB, it is "mongodb"
`Path`||Path for a URI - for MongoDB, it is the database name. The default is `ibmclouddb`.
`Authentication`|`Username`|The username that you use to connect.
`Authentication`|`Password`|A password for the user - might be shown as `$PASSWORD`
`Authentication`|`Method`|How authentication takes place; "direct" authentication is handled by the driver.
`Hosts`|`0...`|A hostname and port to connect to
`Composed`|`0...`|A URI combining Scheme, Authentication, Host, and Path
`Certificate`|`Name`|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate for database deployment
`Certificate`|Base64|A base64 encoded version of the certificate.
{: caption="Table 1. `mongodb`/`URI` connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

Many MongoDB drivers are able to make a connection to your deployment when given the URI-formatted connection string found in the "composed" field of the connection information. For example,
```
mongodb://admin:$PASSWORD@d5eeee66-5bc4-498a-b73b-1307848f1eac.8f7bfd8f3faa4218aec56e069eb46187.databases.appdomain.cloud:30484/ibmclouddb?authSource=admin
```

## Language Drivers

MongoDB has a vast array of language drivers. The table covers a few of the most common.

Language|Driver|Documentation
----------|-----------
Node.js|`mongodb`|[Link](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/)
Go|`mongo`|[Link](https://godoc.org/github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/mongo)
Python|`pymongo`|[Link](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/index.html)
Java|`mongodb-driver-sync`|[Link](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/?jmp=docs)

{: tip}

## Driver TLS and self-signed certificate support

All connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb}} are TLS 1.2 enabled, so the driver you use to connect needs to be able to support encryption. Your deployment also comes with a self-signed certificate so the driver can verify the server upon connection. 

### Using the self-signed certificate

1. Copy the certificate information from the Base64 field of the connection information. 
2. Decode the Base64 string into text and save it to a file. (You can use the Name that is provided or your own file name).
3. Provide the path to the driver.

### CLI plug-in support for the self-signed certificate

You can display the decoded certificate for your deployment with the CLI plug-in with the command `ibmcloud cdb deployment-cacert "your-service-name"`. It decodes the base64 into text. Copy and save the command's output to a file and provide the file's path to the driver.
